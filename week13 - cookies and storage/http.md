## Request and response

The web is powered by the HTTP protocol.

Data is exchanged between clients and servers via HTTP messages.

In order for a client to fetch a piece of resource, it first needs to issue a **request** for it.

The server will then respond accordingly with a **response**, providing the data or telling the server why it can not serve the resource requested.

### Status codes

The server's response will always come with a status code, indicating how a resource was fetched or why it failed.

| Status Code | Meaning               | Description                                                                            |
| ----------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 200         | OK                    | The request was successful.                                                            |
| 304         | Not Modified          | The requested resource has not been modified since the last request.                   |
| 400         | Bad Request           | The server couldn't understand the request.                                            |
| 401         | Unauthorized          | The request requires user authentication or lacks permission.                          |
| 403         | Forbidden             | The server understood the request, but access is forbidden.                            |
| 404         | Not Found             | The requested resource could not be found on the server.                               |
| 500         | Internal Server Error | An unexpected server error occurred.                                                   |
| 502         | Bad Gateway           | The gateway server, received an invalid response from the upstream server it accessed. |
| 503         | Service Unavailable   | The server is currently unable to handle the request.                                  |

### Headers

HTTP messages can be annotated with additional information through the user of **headers**.

Each header is made up of a key-value pair.

It can have different types of headers depending on whether it is a **request** or **response**, as well as which server it comes from.

TODO: show common headers
request url
request method
status code
content type
cookies

TODO: show custom headers
google tracking headers

### Body

## Demonstration of requests and responses

Open the network tab and show them what a HTTP request and response looks like.

Need to remind students that not only 200 means success, 304 as well.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/304

Can demonstrate 304 by visiting a page and refreshing it.
