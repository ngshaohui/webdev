# Node.js

No intention to teach how to use Node.js as it seems to be out of scope, but can have some useful information for further reading.

## Using Node.js

We can run the Node.js JS interpreter from the command line

```bash
node
```

### Running `.js` files

We can also run `.js` files outside the browser by with node.

```bash
node script.js
```

TODO relook at `npm_setup.md` to see how to merge them

Need to talk about using npm to install modules and how to use node_modules
