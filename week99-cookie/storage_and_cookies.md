# Storage and cookies

TODO

In order to access the storage API and cookies, we need to serve our pages over a webserver.

## Storage API: `localStorage`

Local storage offers a way for a website to store persistent data.

## Storage API: `sessionStorage`

Compared to local storage, session storage is only stored until the end of a user's session.

When the web browser, or all tabs of a webpage are closed, this clears the objects stored in `sessionStorage`.
