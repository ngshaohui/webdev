# Week 12 hands on: fetching data

## Activity 1: fetching with the SWR library in React

Since React has a nuanced way of maintaining state within an application, we can opt to use a library to accomplish our data fetching together with the component state management.

### Task 1: Setting up

**Ensure that you are within the right folder before you do the install**

We will need to install the SWR library with NPM

```bash
npm install swr
```

### Task 2: Using SWR to fetch data

For this activity, we will be fetching data from

```jsx
import useSWR from "swr";

// use vanilla fetch as fetcher
// deserialize the fetched data as json
const fetcher = (...args) => fetch(...args).then(res => res.json())

export default function App() {
  const IP_API_URL = "https://docs.freeipapi.com/request.html";
  const { data, error, isLoading } = useSWR(IP_API_URL, fetcher);

  if (error) {
    return <div>failed to load</div>;
  }
  if (isLoading) {
    return <div>loading...</div>;
  }

  // render data
  return <div>Your IP is {data.ipAddress}</div>;
}
```

### Task 3: Fetching our IP information

## Activity 2: Using fetch API to fetch data in React

## Activity 3: Fetching in vanilla JS
