Several popular online tools exist, here are some examples:

- CodePen
- Replit

## Features

What are the main benefits to using browser-based sandbox tools?

### Portability

Work in the browser without downloading any new programs.

Since we only require the browser, we can potentially work on different machines.

### Collaboration

Cloud based tools tend to allow more than one user to work on a project at any one time.

### Sharing

Share your code with other people easily, since it's already online.

## Is having local installations still relevant?

### Offline portability

### Local integrations

Large projects potentially require the use of local databases to test, which can be hosted with docker.

It's still possible to set up such a testing infrastructure for the cloud, but unsure how straightforward it is.

CodeSandbox even allows the installation of npm libraries so it would really just depend on your use case.

### Speed

Local installations usually have the benefit of being more responsive.

But depending on your machine, you may be better off using a browser-based sandbox.
