# Browser devtools

The browser itself already comes with some of the most useful tools we need for debugging our web applications.

- Elements
- Console

We will be taking a look at the developer tools that the Chrome browser provides.

## Elements inspector

The elements tab will indicate how the HTML elements are being laid out on the page.

For each element, it also shows how it is being rendered and gives us a breakdown of the CSS for it.

We can choose to add, edit, or delete any elements here.

The same can be done for CSS elements via the sub-tabs.

### Styles

It shows us what CSS rules are being applied to it and which stylesheets the styles originates from.

It also indicates when there are conflicting styles and their order they are being applied.

It also shows us the CSS box model indicating how much actual space an element takes up.

We can also view the space occupied by the box model when we mouseover the element in the inspector tab, or each specific box model property

### Computed

This shows a comprehensive view of all the CSS rules that have been applied to an element.

### Usage of the elements inspector

The elements inspector can help us figure out why the elements are not being laid out the way we envisioned.

It also gives us a quick way to preview what additional styles we need to apply to achieve it.

## Console

TODO give a short explanation on what this does

Preamble to how we will be keeping this tab open when we do web development that involves javascript
