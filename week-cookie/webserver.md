# Webserver

In the context of webpages, a `server` refers to a software whose responsibility is to "serve" up webpages requested by a client.

In our case, the client would refer to a web browser.

## `index.html`

By default, requesting for the root address `/` will cause the webserver to serve the `index.html` page.
