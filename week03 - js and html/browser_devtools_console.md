# Browser devtools

The browser itself already comes with some of the most useful tools we need for debugging our web applications.

- Elements
- Console

We will be taking a look at the developer tools that the Chrome browser provides.

## Console

The console allows us to interact with JS on the page.

We are able to evaluate JS expressions quickly, without having to create a JS file and loading the script through a HTML file.

We can also view any message outputs from our programs, such as general logs or error messages.
