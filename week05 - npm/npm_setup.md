# NPM Setup

Node.js provides a convenient way to work with JS libraries.

It comes with the Node Package Manager (NPM), a tool which grants us access to JS library repositories.

You can check that Node and NPM is successfully set up by running:

```bash
npm --version
```

Which should tell you what's the currently installed version.

If `npm` is not found, you will get the following message:

```
'npm' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
```
