          The cat (Felis catus) is a domesticated species of small carnivorous
          mammal. It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and
          is commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat to
          distinguish it from the wild members of the family. Cats are commonly
          kept as house pets but can also be farm cats or feral cats; the feral
          cat ranges freely and avoids human contact. Domestic cats are valued
          by humans for companionship and their ability to kill vermin. About 60
          cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.

          The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a
          strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth, and retractable
          claws adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats. Its night
          vision and sense of smell are well developed. Cat communication
          includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing,
          growling, and grunting as well as cat-specific body language. Although
          the cat is a social species, it is a solitary hunter. As a predator,
          it is crepuscular, i.e. most active at dawn and dusk. It can hear
          sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as
          those made by mice and other small mammals. It also secretes and
          perceives pheromones.

          Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn in
          temperate zones and throughout the year in equatorial regions, with
          litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens. Domestic cats are
          bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known
          as cat fancy. Population control of cats may be achieved by spaying
          and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has
          resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the
          extinction of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species.
