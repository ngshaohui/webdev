# Week 17 presentation and submission

Please note that you have to come to class to showcase the project that you have done. Attendance is compulsory!

Each group will take turns presenting, and each member can take up to 2 minutes (it's alright if you don't use up all the time, but make sure not to overrun) presenting their feature.

During the presentation, you will need to talk about what your feature does and give a live demonstration of it. You can take this chance to point out any interactive features, as well as how it links back to your group's chosen theme.

Submission will take place online on 8th February 2359, so it's completely alright to continue to work on it a bit more and tidy up your codebase before submission.

With that in mind, I would recommend that you have a feature freeze starting from Monday (5th Feb), to prevent the possibility of breaking changes being introduced into your code base.

If you haven't done so already, please start to do your integration into a single codebase during the weekend, and sort out any issues that may arise.
